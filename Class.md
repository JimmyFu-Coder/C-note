# Encapsulation

Encapsulation allows you to ==hide details==. The details can still be accessed when necessary, but by intelligently encapsulating the details, large programs are made easier to understand, data is protected from inadvertent modification




# Inheritance
Inheritance in object-oriented programming allows you to form “==is a kind of==” relationships between these similar but different items. You will have defined a class hierarchy, which is a series of “is a kind of” relationships. You can view the class hierarchy graphically using a Unified Modeling Language (UML)–like class diagram, as shown in Figure

The more specialized type is called the ==derived type or the subtype==. The more general type is called the ==base type or the super type==.Derived types allow you to organize your classes into a coherent hierarchy where the derived types have greater specificity than their base types.

# Polymorphism
In the context of objects, polymorphism means that a single method or type can have many forms of implementation.
